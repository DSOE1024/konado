# About Konado

## Project Overview

Konado is a visual novel engine framework based on Godot Engine, driven by the open-source community. Konado is dedicated to providing developers with an efficient and convenient visual novel development experience, empowering creators to quickly build high-quality visual novel works.

## Konado Project

The Konado Project development team is a community-driven open-source project group under the [Godot Hub](https://godothub.com) community. We are committed to the development, maintenance, and continuous growth of the Konado project. We welcome all developers interested in the Konado project to join us in advancing the improvement and innovation of open-source initiatives, contributing to the open-source ecosystem.

## Our Goal

We are committed to independently developing a comprehensive visual novel game framework without relying on any existing third-party solutions. Konado aims to create more user-friendly and efficient tools, enabling game creators to focus on storytelling and artistic expression rather than getting bogged down in implementation details.
