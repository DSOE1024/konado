The Kona character design for Konado Version 2.0 pays exceptional attention to detail, featuring a more dynamic and lively overall silhouette that fully captures the vibrant energy of a young girl:
- **Hair**: The short pink-purple hair is light and fluffy, with natural, flowing strands. A star-shaped hair accessory pinned to one side—a small, exquisite design resembling a twinkling star in the night sky—adds a touch of playfulness and dreaminess.
- **Attire**: The inner layer is a top with a sailor collar, evoking a youthful school vibe. The bright orange tie at the neckline cleverly breaks the monotony of the basic design. Over this, a light gray cardigan is layered, its soft tone balancing the inner layer's brightness while adding a casual, cozy feel. The bottom is a blue pleated skirt that sways gently with movement, highlighting the girl's cute and lively charm.
- **Accessories**: The socks are a highlight of this design—featuring rich, gradient colors with a bold "KONADO" logo on one side (simple and clean, reinforcing brand identity). They are also adorned with vibrant triangular geometric patterns that complement the overall lively style, making the leg lines appear more dynamic. The white shoes are simple and versatile, ensuring the outfit's completeness without stealing the spotlight.
