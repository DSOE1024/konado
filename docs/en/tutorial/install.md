# Konado Installation Guide

## Dependencies and Environment

Konado requires Godot 4.4 or later. It is recommended to use the latest version of Godot.

## Installation

1. Create `addons` folder in your Godot project folder, if it does not exist.
2. Download the latest release zip file from the release page.
3. Extract the zip file to the `addons` folder (This will create a `konado` folder inside `addons`).
4. Enable the Konado addon in your project settings, to do this, go to `Project -> Project Settings -> Addons` and check the konado addon. Then save and reopen the project.

**Tip:** When you install Konado for the first time, Godot may print some error messages. You can safely ignore these, as they will be resolved after you enable the addon and reopen the project.
